# sql_hackerrank_challenge_by_xuan
### About:
* This repository documents my solutions to the sql challenge questions on HackerRank for future reference.
* Gold badge has been earned!

### Note:
* CTEs and window functions are not supported as of May 9, 2023 by HackerRank when this README is created, likely due to the site having older verson of MySQL. Hence, some challenges may have better solutions with CTEs or window functions but were solved with alternative, basic syntax instead.
* Links to individual challenges are not included for the sake of time but can be easily located on HackerRank.

### Usage:
* Feel free to use my solutions as reference, and should you have better solutions for some of the challenge questions, please also kindly share with me!
